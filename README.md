# Projet_Data_Innovant-
Open data project related to low mobilities in Grenoble city area 
Problems of adding files : 

- error related to ' .git/index.lock ' something like that created =>  rm -f .git/index.lock in the terminal (not needed git in front of )
- error type 'zsh not found' after 'add .' or 'add file' command , means you need to push your work , so ' git push '
-If you want to modify this README file , you need to save changes before commit , otherwise changes won't be take into consideration.
